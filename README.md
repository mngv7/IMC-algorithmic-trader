## Description

The IMC Trading Algorithm project showcases two well-known trading strategies: Mean Reversion and Linear Regression. These strategies are implemented to demonstrate coding skills in the context of the IMC Trading Challenge 2024.

## Strategies

### Mean Reversion Strategy

The Mean Reversion strategy operates based on the assumption that the price of a security will tend to move to the average price over time. The implementation includes:
- Position limits for each product.
- Price history tracking.
- Calculation of short-term and long-term simple moving averages (SMA).
- Buy/Sell logic based on SMA comparisons.

### Linear Regression Strategy

The Linear Regression strategy predicts the future price of a security based on past prices using linear regression. The implementation includes:
- Calculation of linear regression parameters (slope and intercept).
- Prediction of future prices based on the linear regression model.

## Installation

This project is specific to the IMC Trading Challenge 2024 and is not intended for general use. The code is not functional outside of the IMC Trading simulator environment.

## Usage

As mentioned, this project is specific to the IMC Trading Challenge 2024 and is not usable outside the IMC Trading simulator.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required for this project.

## Contributing

There are no specific guidelines for contributing to this project.

## License

The license for this project is currently unspecified.
